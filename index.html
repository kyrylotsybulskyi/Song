        <p>           No one knows what it's like
           To be the bad man
           To be the sad man
           Behind blue eyes
           And no one knows what it's like
           To be hated
           To be fated to telling only lies
           But my dreams they aren't as empty
           As my conscience seems to be
           I have hours, only lonely
           My love is <span>vengeance</span>
           That's never free

           No one knows what its like
           To feel these feelings
           Like I do
           And I blame you
           No one bites back as hard
           On their anger
           None of my pain and woe
           Can show through
           But my dreams they aren't as empty
           As my conscience seems to be
           I have hours, only lonely
           My love is vengeance
           That's <span>never free</span>
           No one knows what its like
           To be mistreated, to be defeated
